# playsprite
A small tool for converting aseprite files into a format readable on the Playdate.

I'm playing around with custom files for the sprites used in Playdate. I like using Aseprite, so I wanted to figure out if there was an easy way to store just aseprite in my project directory and have something convert when I build the .pdx.
